# Handwritten Digit Recognition Neural Network

This project implements a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. This project aims to build a neural network model capable of accurately identifying handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits, along with their corresponding labels. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Model Architecture

The neural network architecture used for this task consists of:

- Input layer: 784 neurons (28x28 pixels)
- Hidden layers: 2 layers with 16 neurons each.
- Output layer: 10 neurons (corresponding to digits 0-9)

TODO: Add details about activation functions, loss function, optimizer, etc.
